ans:-1    object oriented programming:- programing pradigm based on the concept of object ,which can contain data and code,data in the from of field and code in the from of procedures.
A common features of object is that procedures are attached to them and can access and modify the object data fields in the brand of oop,there is usally a special name such as 
this or self used refer to the current object.in oop computer program are design by making theam out of object that interface with one another.


ans:-2 there are three major features in object oriented programing that makes them dofferent than non-language: encapsulation ,inheritance,and polymorphism

ans:-3 
         abstract class:- 1)abstract class can have abstact and non abstract method 
                                     2)abstract class doest support multi inheritance
                                     3) abstract class can have final ,non final static and non static variables.
                                      4)abstract class can provide the implement of interface

           interface:- 1) interface can have only abstrsct  methods since java 8 it can have defalut and static method also
                              2) interface support multiple inheritance
                              3) interface has only static and final variable
                              4)interface cant provide the implementation of abstract class
